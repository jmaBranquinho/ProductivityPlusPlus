# ProductivityPlusPlus
New tool I've created to help me be more productive. May be useful for someone else. It's based on an older and much less optimized tool I've been using for a few years (some features were removed and others are still pending)

*clipboard extension - use CTRL and any number from 0 to 9 to copy a value to the clipboard. Use CTRL SHIFT and a number to paste the value. The GUI contains the saved values. If you want to copy a single word, no need to select the word, just click anywhere in it.

*alternate case - use CTRL SHIFT A to alternate the case of the word (pascal/camel)

*text to speech - use CTRL SHIFT L to read the content of the clipboard
